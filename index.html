            <p>The Queer Book Club was created to bring DC residing, queer identifying people together. We read one book a month, not limited to any genre, it could be science fiction, non-fiction, or a cookbook. We want to explore the ways in which different topics can be interpreted through a queer lens. </p>
            <p>We focus on the importance of community building, intersectionality, representation, and respect.</p>
