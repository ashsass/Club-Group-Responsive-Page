# Club-Group-Responsive-Page
One of the off project codes for the full stack developer program on Codecademy.
The purpose is to create a website for a fictional club using whatever layout style I want, but trying to focus on respoinsive web design.
I have chosen to work on the grid layout, since I have not worked much with grid styling. 
I have done a few projects with flexbox, but I'm interested in how I will fare with grids.
